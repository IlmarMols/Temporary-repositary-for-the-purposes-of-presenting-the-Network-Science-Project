So... i do not quite understand the code i made - it is broken and a number of its more important parts are missing(visual studio code froze at a time when the code was not saved).

The main code is in "Project_birdwatchi_andmetega.ipynb" - there i test the API + make the networks and clusters and all the .csv files that fill this project folder.

To see how i visualized everything you need rstudio!
If you have RStudio open "visualiseerimine.Rmd" and see the results for yourself.

The file "projecti_tegemis_katse_ilma_birdwatchita.ipynb" contains the remains of the attempt to ignore the birdwatch dataset, and go with Kaggle and combine existing other datasets and make a network course project this way.

"Old_useless_data" folder contains the Kaggle and the replacement datasets(well, besides the "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140" as it was too large), as well as the aliases for the community notes makers(as they are usually pseudonymed in the metadata). "asukohad.txt" is a link from where i got the list of real usernames.

"data" folder used to contain the large .tsv files that the birdwatch community notes related information came in - they were too massive for me to push to git or add directly to moodle - so, if you are intrested in getting to know what birdwatch data really looks like, go to here: "https://x.com/i/birdwatch/download-data" and download one of each(note that i rename the "batSignals-00000.tsv to "note_request.tsv" for the purposes of clarity).

"Presentation_day_graph" was the graph made with GraphSAGE in a desperate attempt in final moments to have some results to show during the project presentation. The code that made it was destroyed for obvious reasons.
